# Problem 1
# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

### Introduction
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, after being projected with an initial velocity. One of the key characteristics of projectile motion is the range, which depends on the angle of projection. This investigation aims to analyze how the range varies as a function of the launch angle.

### Theory
The motion of a projectile launched from ground level can be analyzed using the equations of kinematics. The horizontal and vertical components of motion are given by:

- **Horizontal motion:**
  $$
  x = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot t
  $$
- **Vertical motion:**
  $$
  y = v_0 \sin(\theta) \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  $$

where:
- \( x \) and \( y \) are the horizontal and vertical displacements, respectively,
- \( v_0 \) is the initial velocity,
- \( \theta \) is the angle of projection,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and
- \( t \) is the time of flight.

The time of flight \( T \) can be found by setting \( y = 0 \):
  $$
  T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
  $$

The range \( R \) of the projectile is given by:
  $$
  R = v_0 \cos(\theta) \cdot T
  $$
Substituting \( T \):
  $$
  R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
  $$
This equation shows that the range is maximized when \( \sin(2\theta) \) is maximized, which occurs at \( 2\theta = 90^\circ \), or \( \theta = 45^\circ \).

### Experimental Setup
To experimentally verify the dependence of range on the angle of projection, the following setup can be used:

#### **Materials:**
- A **projectile launcher**
- A **protractor**
- A **measuring tape**
- A **stopwatch**
- A **smooth launch surface**

#### **Procedure:**
1. Set the launcher to a known initial velocity.
2. Adjust the angle of projection in increments (e.g., 10°, 20°, ..., 80°).
3. Measure and record the range for each angle.
4. Repeat the trials to ensure accuracy and calculate the average range.

### Conclusion
The investigation confirms the theoretical prediction that the range of a projectile follows a sinusoidal dependence on the angle of projection, with a maximum at 45°. This study is essential in applications such as ballistics, sports, and engineering.
