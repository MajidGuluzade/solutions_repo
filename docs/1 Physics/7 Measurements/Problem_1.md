# Problem 1
# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Overview
This exercise involves measuring the acceleration due to gravity (**𝑔**) using a simple pendulum, analyzing uncertainties, and discussing experimental limitations. The pendulum’s period depends on **𝑔**, allowing us to calculate it via precise measurements of length and oscillation time.

## Procedure Recap and Assumptions

### Materials:
- 1-meter string
- Small weight (e.g., bag of coins)
- Stopwatch
- Ruler

### Setup:
- Measure pendulum length (**𝐿**) from pivot to the center of mass.
- Ruler resolution: 1 mm (0.001 m), so uncertainty **𝛿𝐿 = 0.0005 m**.

### Data Collection:
- Displace pendulum <15° to ensure small-angle approximation.
- Time 10 oscillations (**𝑡₁₀**) 10 times.
- Stopwatch resolution: 0.01 s, with human reaction time (~0.1 s) adding uncertainty.

### Formula:
- **𝑇 = 2π √(𝐿/𝑔)**

## Example Data
Since no specific data was provided, we use realistic values:

- Length: **𝐿 = 1.000 m**, **𝛿𝐿 = 0.0005 m**
- Time for 10 oscillations (s, 10 trials):  
  20.12, 20.08, 20.15, 20.10, 20.09, 20.11, 20.13, 20.07, 20.14, 20.10.
